# WhoRepresentsYou?

WhoRepresentsYou? (WRY?) is a web application built in the JavaScript programming language (with some help from the jQuery and Underscore libraries). WRY? is built using a Model-View-Controller architectural pattern.

WRY? is an application that allows users to search for and view information about their Senators and Congresswoman/Congressman. The purpose of WRY? is to allow users to view information such as a representative's biography, voting history, missed votes, etc. WRY? utilizes the New York Times Congress API to retrieve congressional data.
